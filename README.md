- **Integrity** is the property of information whereby it is recorded, used, and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency, and usefulness for a stated purpose.
- **Availability** means that systems and data are accessible at the time users need them.

  A: Confidentiality 

- Privacy is the right of an individual to control the distribution of information about themselves.

- Q: Which region enacted comprehensive legislation addressing personal privacy in 2016?
  
  A: European Union

  # Risk Management
- The level of cyber security required depends on the level of risk involved. Risk can be from malware, social engineering or denial of service attacks or from some other situations that affect our environment such as fire, violent crime or natural disasters.

- High probability Low impact
- High probability Highimpact
- Low probability Low impact
- Low probability Low impact

- Q: What is the purpose of implementing security controls in the risk management process?
  
  A: To mitigate the risk to an acceptable level
  
- Q: If a pickpocket is a threat, what would be their attack vector?

  A: Their techniques and approach

  # ISC2 Code of ethics
  - Protect society, the common good and infrastructure
  - Act honorably, honestly, responsibly and legally
  - Provide diligent and competent service to principals
  - Advance and protect the profession
    
 - An organization while doing the interview will be using an iris scanner to identify the candidate thus they can identify male and female and if the female candidate is pregnant or not thereby not choosing that candidate.

 # Risk in our Lives
- One example when you book a vacation.
- You might be considering a Carribbean cruise where the weather can be a factor and your trip could be canceled.
- In that case you purchase travel insurance to transfer the risk.
- So we won't lose out our prepaid expenses.

- Q: How do companies that offer identity theft insurance manage their own financial risk?

- Q: What potential risk can occur when a remote worker's laptop is left unattended or unlocked?

# Privacy in working environment
- HIPPA : Health Insurance, Portability and Accountability Act (USA) --> This act will control how the privacy of medical information must be maintained

● An asset: is something in need of protection.

● A vulnerability: is a gap or weakness in those protection efforts.

● A threat: is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection 
  efforts.

# Decision Making Based on Risk Prioritie
- When making decisions based on risk priorities, organizations must evaluate the likelihood and impact of the risk as well as their tolerance for different sorts of risk.

# Importance of Governance Elements

- **Regulations and Laws**: Regulations and associated fines can be imposed by governments at national, regional or local level.

  Eg: - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - European Union
      - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) - United States

- **Standards**: Cover broad range of issues and ideas.

 Eg: ISO (International Organization for Standardization), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)

 - Procedures are the detailed steps
to complete a task that support
departmental or organizational polici

● Identify risk to communicate it clearly.

● Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.

● Identify risk to protect against it.

- Security professionals are likely to assist in risk assessment at a system level, focusing on process, control, monitoring, or incident response and recovery.

- A low likelihood and a low impact might result in a low priority, while an incident with
a high likelihood and high impact will result in a high priority.

# Authentication
**There are three common methods of authentication:**
- Something you know: Passwords or passphrases
  
- Something you have: Tokens, memory cards, smart cards

- Something you are: Biometrics, measurable characteristic

- **Procedures** are the detailed steps to complete a task that support departmental or organizational policies.
  
- **Policies** are put in place by organizational governance, such as executive management, to provide guidance in all activities to ensure that the organization supports industry standards and regulations.
  
- **Standards** are often used by governance teams to provide a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations.
  
- **Regulations** are commonly issued in the form of laws, usually from government (not to be confused with governance) and typically carry financial penalties for non-compliance.
